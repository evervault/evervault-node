### Commit Messages

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work) for deployments. If one of your commits should be deployed, ensure the commit message is in the format corresponding to the correct release type. This can also be done in a squash commit.

Note: breaking changes should always use the `BREAKING CHANGE:` commit message format.
